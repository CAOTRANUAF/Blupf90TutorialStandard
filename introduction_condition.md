About the software
==================

Condition of use
----------------

For the detailed information about the condition of use and the support, please visit the official wiki (<http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php>).
The programs are free for research, but the publication should acknowledge the use of the programs.
For the non-research purposes, please contact Ignacy Misztal (`ignacy@uga.edu`).


Bug report and support
----------------------

A bug report is welcome.
Please contact one of the developers at UGA or the other institutes.
Or, please post the report to Yahoo Group (<https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/blupf90/info>).
Limited support may be available at Yahoo Group because the support is volunteer-based.
Github Issues is also a place for discussion (`https://github.com/ABGG-UGA/blupf90-public`).
If you need full support for the programs, please consider visiting our team.
