In this chapter, we will see how BLUPF90 applies to a variety of models. We will look at various
models in a standard textbook, *Linear Models for the Prediction of Animal Breeding Values*, written by Mrode (2014).
We explain how to write a parameter file to handle a model in his book.
We will not represent the content of data, pedigree, and genotype files.
You can easily create these files if you have the book.
We do not only solve the equations but do introduce new options and tricks useful for actual data analyses.
