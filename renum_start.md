This chapter provides an instruction on RENUMF90 to prepare the files for data, pedigree, genomic markers, and parameters. 
LUPF90 requires several files with a particular format which the "raw" data may not have.
RENUMF90 can check the raw files and convert them to new files suitable for the BLUPF90 suite.
We will start with a minimal example as before.
